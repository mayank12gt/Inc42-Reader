<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when the RBI curbs could have a far-reaching impact on India’s biggest fintech firm and result in the annulment of its payments bank licence, the Paytm CEO is receiving full support from his colleagues and veterans from the startup ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, this is also one of the rare instances in which even bankers and analysts, let alone founders, have criticised the RBI and termed its diktat ‘harsh’. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it was still unclear until yesterday </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what the RBI’s stance might mean for Paytm, analysts see t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he RBI directive impacting revenues of offline merchants, FASTtag payments, wallets business and several other propositions of Paytm.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a bid to mitigate the impact of the RBI diktat, the company has said that it will accelerate the transfer of its nodal accounts to other banks to minimise the impact on business continuity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the uninitiated, the apex bank also issues directions to terminate the Nodal Accounts of One97 Communications Ltd and Paytm Payments Services Ltd at the earliest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Paytm CEO has extended his gratitude to the startup community.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you everyone for your relentless support. Obviously, a conversation at a wider level should help. We should not let anything deter us from what we all have built over so many years. The Indian Startup Dream must overcome every situation collectively. Here, for good,&#8221; Sharma said.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving on, stakeholders of the Indian startup space have openly criticised the RBI for being dismissive of tech entrepreneurship. Some have even called out the RBI for targeting the Indian fintech sector, which is often seen bogged down in regulatory challenges.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-440672 size-full" src="https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage.jpeg" alt="" width="1360" height="923" srcset="https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage.jpeg 1360w, https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage-300x204.jpeg 300w, https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage-1024x695.jpeg 1024w, https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage-600x407.jpeg 600w, https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage-150x102.jpeg 150w, https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage-210x143.jpeg 210w, https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage-100x68.jpeg 100w, https://inc42.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Paytm-payments-bank-collage-400x271.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also crucial to note that the RBI has maintained that the new curbs on Paytm Payments Bank have been slapped due to “persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2022, the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank to stop </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-barred-from-onboarding-new-customers-again-rbi-to-audit-systems/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onboarding new customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite Paytm expressing confidence earlier that </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">good news would be received on this front by March 2024</span></a><b>, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ban has not been lifted by the central bank yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the larger Indian payments bank arena, Paytm rivals players like Airtel Payments Bank, Fino Payments Bank and Jio Payments Bank. While Paytm Payments Bank was incorporated in August 2016, Jio followed suit with a similar offering just three months later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank’s latest regulatory whiplash has come at a time when the oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries’ fintech arm, Jio Financial Services, is making serious headway into the country’s much-regulated fintech space. Even analysts and sectoral experts, see the incursion of the behemoth (RIL) in the fintech domain as a threat to the likes of Paytm and others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBI’s latest stance to tighten its noose on the VSS-led fintech also comes at a time when there is growing fondness for reverse flipping among Indian startups based in foreign lands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the Desh Wapsi plans of fintech startups like Groww, Pine Labs, and Razorpay are in full swing. However, the latest RBI-Paytm chapter has the potential to make Indian startups settled abroad reconsider their stance, for the industry stalwarts have time and again raised concerns over heavy regulatory compliances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it remains to be seen what step will the apex bank take to soften its blow after its Paytm stance, fears are brewing unabated that more such moves have the potential to derail the country’s fintech </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Paytm stock opened the day at its lower circuit of INR 609.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting the interim Budget for 2024-25, the finance minister said that the government has extended 43 Cr loans amounting to INR 22.5 Lakh Cr under PMMY till February 1. Of these, nearly 70% loans have been given to women entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The empowerment of women through entrepreneurship, ease of living, and dignity for them has gained momentum in these ten years,&#8221; the finance minister said in her speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FM also said that female enrolment in higher education has gone up by 28% in the past 10 years. She further pointed out that girls and women constitute 43% enrolment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses in India. “All these measures are getting reflected in the increasing participation of women in the workforce,” she added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PMMY scheme was launched by the government on April 8, 2015 for providing loans of up to 10 Lakh to the non-corporate, non-farm small/micro enterprises. These loans are classified as MUDRA loans under PMMY. These loans are given by commercial banks, regional rural banks, small finance banks, microfinance institutions and non banking financial corporations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to X to laud the FM’s announcement. &#8220;Under PM Mudra Yojana, more than 30 crore collateral-free loans have been given to women entrepreneurs. This is not only boosting their entrepreneurial ambitions but also ensuring better growth in the country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government has taken a number of initiatives over the last few years to promote startups in the country. Encouraging women entrepreneurs and increasing participation of women in the workforce is a key part of this initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of this, </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/president-murmu-launch-startup-platform-women-entrepreneurs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Droupadi Murmu launched a startup platform </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">called ‘Her Start’ for women entrepreneurs in October 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the number of women founders have increased in the Indian startup ecosystem. A number of </span><a href="https://inc42.com/features/meet-the-30-women-torchbearers-of-indias-startup-investment-space/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women investors also feature prominently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the homegrown startup ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Inc42&#8217;s</span><a href="https://inc42.com/reports/indian-tech-startup-funding-report-2023/#sponsor-report-pop-434708"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indian Tech Startup Funding Report 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, women led startups raised a funding of over $475 Mn last year in 118 deals. However, this was a 80% drop from the $2.4 Bn secured in 2022 and around 90% from the $4.7 Bn women led startups secured in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, union minister </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/vcs-investing-in-too-few-women-led-startups-minister-smriti-irani/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smriti Irani criticised venture capital </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VC) funds for not backing enough women-led innovative startups and instead focussing more on entities founded by men. The union minister for women and child development also suggested that business schools impart negotiating skills to their students, especially girls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indus has future plans for expansion to consoles and PCs. The game features an Indian-inspired map design, characters, and a unique twist with the introduction of Cosmium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roby John, CEO and cofounder of SuperGaming said that the pre-registrations surpassed 8.5 Mn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John added, “We thank all our playtest players, esports pros, and content creators for playing their part in building India’s gaming revolution with us, now it’s India&#8217;s and the world&#8217;s turn to play Indus.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game achieves 60 fps on 2023 Android flagships with maximum visual details. This accessibility, with a playable experience on smartphones, comes at a price around Rs. 8,000 (approximately $100). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sujeet Kumar, technical director at SuperGaming, said that the focus is on mobile players, treating them as first-class citizens and optimising the game for a seamless experience using the custom-built Indus engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indus is expected to run on most smartphones purchased from 2020 onwards, with visual fidelity subject to individual hardware and custom graphics settings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes at a time when the </span><a href="https://inc42.com/resources/indias-gaming-landscape-monetisation-trends-and-evolving-user-dynamics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian gaming industry reached 568 Mn gamers in FY23</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with 25% of them being paying users, as per Lumikai’s report. The number of gamers in India increased by 12% compared to the previous year, and the number of paying users experienced even stronger growth at 17%, the report added. These statistics indicate that the Indian gaming landscape is maturing and evolving beyond the realm of casual games.</span></p>

<p>Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the launch of a National Data Governance Policy to enable access to anonymised data in her Budget speech last year.</p>
<p>The policy is expected to address one of the major hiccups for adoption of AI in the country – the lack of datasets – by enabling widespread access to anonymised data.</p>
<p>The government first introduced the draft National Data Governance Framework Policy in 2022 to ensure that non-personal data and anonymised data from both government and private entities are safely accessible to the research and innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) also issued the draft India Data Accessibility and Use Policy to facilitate government data sharing, but it faced criticism for various reasons. In May 2022, the ministry released the draft National Data Governance Framework, replacing the earlier version.</p>
<p>It is still not clear if the mandate for sharing anonymised data under the framework released in May 2022 applies to government entities only or includes private entities as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, India got its data protection law earlier last year. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on August 7 and in the Rajya Sabha two days later. On August 11, President Droupadi Murmu finally granted her assent to the Bill to become an Act.</p>
<p>The DPDP Act directs setting up a Data Protection Board of India to ensure its implementation. In case of any personal data breach, the board will be responsible for looking into the matter, inquiring into the breach and imposing penalties.</p>
<p>The Centre may release the administrative rules under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules and notify the final version of the Bill soon.</p>
<p>Last month, executives from social media and internet intermediaries met with senior officials from MeitY. The discussions focused on crucial topics, including child gating, the formulation of consent architecture, and the delineation of rights and obligations for data principals.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple accounted for 23% of smartphone revenue share in 2023, despite capturing just around 6.5% market share by volume &#8211; its highest ever &#8211; as compared to Samsung which had 18% volume share and 21% revenue share, followed by Vivo with 13% revenue share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech major logged over 50% year-on-year (YoY) growth in smartphone shipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Samsung led the market in 2023 with an 18% share driven by a strong performance of the A series, aggressive marketing in offline, and focussed approach in the premium segment. vivo ranked second with a 17% share and led the affordable premium segment in 2023 driven by CMF (colour, material, finish)-focused V29 series and T series in offline and online, respectively. Xiaomi slipped to the third spot in 2023 but captured the top spot in Q4 2023 driven by its strategy to launch 5G phones in the affordable segment, offline expansion and a leaner portfolio,” said Shubham Singh, research analyst, Counterpoint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings also pointed out that the premium smartphone market, which comprises phones worth over INR 30,000, witnessed a 64% YoY growth, driven by easy availability of financing schemes, which were behind the sales of every third premium smartphone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Apple’s focus on India is also aiding the trend, with the brand surpassing the 10 Mn unit mark in shipments and capturing the top position in revenue in a calendar year for the first time, propelled by robust demand for both its latest and older iPhones,” Singh added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, Apple reported that its </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/apple-india-revenue-nears-6-bn-milestone-in-fy23/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India business recorded a revenue of INR 49.3K Cr (almost $6 Bn) in FY23</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, marking an increase of 48% from INR 33.3K Cr ($4.03 Bn) in FY22. According to RoC filings, Apple India generates 94.6% of its revenue from sales of products and 5.4% from maintenance and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The net profit surged 76% to INR 2,229 Cr in FY23 from INR 1,263 Cr in FY22, as per the filings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a separate report by CyberMedia Research (CMR) earlier said that the tech giant’s shipments grew by </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/apple-set-to-capture-7-of-the-indian-smartphone-market-by-year-end/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">68% year-on-year (YoY) in the first half of 2023.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Further, during this period, Apple secured 6% of the Indian smartphone market by dominating the premium phone segment prices in the range of INR 50,000 to INR 1,00,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per an ET report,</span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/apple-manufactured-iphones-worth-inr-1-lakh-cr-in-india-in-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apple manufactured iPhones worth INR 1 Lakh Cr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in India last year. An official told the news publication that the company ‘sharply’ ramped up its production in the country last year versus the year before. As per the report, the freight on board (FOB) value of the Apple devices stood at INR 1 Lakh Cr while the market value of the production stood between INR 1.5 Lakh Cr to INR 1.7 Lakh Cr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company manufactured and exported five device models out of India between January and December– iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14 and iPhone 15. The exported &#8216;Made in India&#8217; phones were worth INR 65,000 Cr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For quite some time now, Apple has been looking to boost its footprint across the Indian market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iPhone maker is reportedly </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/apple-scouts-for-new-suppliers-for-critical-components-in-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scouting for Indian, Japanese and South Korean suppliers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who can provide critical components to its contract manufacturers in India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple is in preliminary talks with potential suppliers capable of custom-designing and producing parts and machinery for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), as well as those who currently act as contract manufacturers for several global firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several suppliers have already begun investing in new capabilities, machinery and equipment, positioning themselves as potential suppliers to Apple pending an extensive cycle of certification and approvals, according to Mint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also aims to manufacture more </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/apple-aims-to-ramp-up-iphone-production-in-india-to-over-50-mn-units-annually/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">than 50 Mn iPhones in India by March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually, as it looks to double down on production in the country as part of its efforts to reduce reliance on China. It aims to meet the target within the next two to three years, with additional tens of millions of units planned to be produced in the following years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s step away from China is fuelled by ongoing geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington DC. Further, the Centre’s lucrative production-linked incentives (PLIs) for manufacturers in the country have also led the company to pivot into India. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April last year, Apple </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/apple-iphone-production-in-india-tripled-to-7-bn-in-fy23/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased its iPhone production in India from a mere 1%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its total capacity in 2021 to around 7%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoho earns revenue by selling its software and charging subscription fees to its customers across six continents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North America continued to be the biggest contributor to Zoho’s revenue at INR 3,988.3 Cr, or 45.8% of its operating revenue. The North American market had generated a revenue of INR 3,198.4 Cr in the previous fiscal year. </span></p>

<h2><b>Where Did Zoho Spend? </b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm stock opened at a lower circuit, at INR 609 apiece, down 20% on the NSE compared to the previous session&#8217;s closing price. On Wednesday, the company settled at INR 761 per share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, brokerage firm Jefferies has </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/jefferies-downgrades-paytm-after-rbi-ban-halves-target-price-to-inr-500/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">downgraded the payment aggregator to ‘underperform’ from a ‘buy’ call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and reduced the target price for the stock by more than half to INR 500 from INR 1,050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferies’ new target price reflects a downside potential of over 34% for the Paytm stock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cut EBITDA (ex-ESOP) by 46%/ 44% in FY25/26E led by a 7-10% cut to payments revenues and a 17-24% cut in lending revenues and compression in payments margins. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the impact of a 10% change in disbursements is low on revenues (2%), but high on EBITDA (15%). We adjust our DCF valuations to account for lower growth and margins. Our implied valuation multiple stands reduced by 30% to 15X FY26E EBITDA,” Jefferies said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RBI’s actions directly impact the wallet business and profitability of merchant payments business, which can impact EBITDA by 20-30%. We see the impact being much larger due to reputational concerns around the group. Lending business (~20% of revenues) can be significantly hit if lending partners cut back or limit their exposure. These drive us to cut FY25-26 EBITDA estimates by 45%, which will also delay profitability,” the brokerage firm added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brokerage firm Macquarie said the implications of the RBI ban are quite serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the severe restrictions imposed on PBPL, we believe it significantly hampers Paytm’s ability to retain customers in its ecosystem, and accordingly restricts it from selling payment products and loan products. We think revenue and profitability implications in the medium to long term could be significant and remain a key item to monitor,” said Macquarie’s Suresh Ganapathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motilal Oswal, a domestic brokerage, has also downgraded Paytm&#8217;s rating to neutral, revising the target price to INR 575. Expressing serious concerns over its business outlook and the impact on investor confidence, Motilal Oswal remains vigilant about Paytm&#8217;s adaptability in the face of the uncertain regulatory and macro environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the filing, the latest RBI action will </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-action-on-paytm-payments-bank-to-impact-up-to-inr-500-cr-in-paytms-annual-ebitda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost it INR 300-500 Cr in annual EBITDA </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">going forward.</span></p>
<h2><b>Paytm Payment Bank’s Frequent Run-Ins With The RBI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time Paytm Payments Bank has come into RBI’s crosshairs. According to the January 31 RBI press note, the action comes after Paytm Payments Bank’s “persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, the central bank slapped the listed fintech giant’s subsidiary with </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-slaps-inr-5-39-cr-penalty-on-paytm-payments-bank-for-violating-kyc-norms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an INR 5.39 Cr penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for non-compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) norms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the RBI also flagged six major issues with the payments bank, including failure to identify beneficial owners in respect of onboarded entities for providing payout services, the failure to monitor payout transactions and carry out risk profiling of entities availing payout services, and failure to report cybersecurity incidents without delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2022, the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to stop onboarding new customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a restriction which is still ongoing. While the payments bank expressed hope in September 2023 that the restrictions </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be lifted in March 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the latest RBI action might have thrown a spanner in the works on that front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joshi’s comment comes a day after the </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-bars-paytm-payments-bank-from-providing-upi-service-taking-deposits-in-customer-accounts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBI has barred Paytm Payments Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from any deposits or credit transactions, or top-ups in any of its customer accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pointed out a recurring pattern where Paytm did not diligently follow know your customer (KYC) protocols. This has prompted regulatory intervention by the RBI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite receiving multiple warnings, Paytm has failed to take responsibility for these lapses. This development is not exclusive to Paytm Payments Bank but serves as a wake-up call for all payment banks to promptly enhance their compliance and regulatory adherence,” Joshi told CNBC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Paytm Payments Bank has been a disaster in the making since October 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank in a statement on January 31, said, “No further deposits or credit transactions or top-ups shall be allowed in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, NCMC cards (National Common Mobility Cards), etc. after February 29, 2024, other than any interest, cashbacks, or refunds which may be credited anytime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI said that the Nodal Accounts of One97 Communications Ltd and Paytm Payments Services Ltd. are to be terminated at the earliest, in any case by February 29, 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulator has taken the step after Paytm Payments Bank’s “persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm Payments Bank, associated with One 97 Communications Limited (OCL), is taking immediate steps to comply with RBI’s directions. OCL, a payments company, works with various banks, not just Paytm Payments Bank, on various payment products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exchange filing on February 1, Paytm said that its wholly-owned banking subsidiary “is taking immediate steps to comply with RBI directions, including working with the regulator to address their concerns as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the directive to terminate the nodal account of OCL and Paytm Payments Services Limited (PPSL) by February 29, 2024, both entities will transition the nodal account to alternative banks within this timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, brokerage firm Jefferies has downgraded the payment aggregator to ‘underperform’ from a ‘buy’ call and reduced the target price for the stock by more than half to INR 500 from INR 1,050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferies’ new target price reflects a downside potential of over 34% for the Paytm stock.</span></p>
<h2><b>Paytm Payment Bank’s Frequent Run-Ins With The RBI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time Paytm Payments Bank has come into RBI’s crosshairs. According to the January 31 RBI press note, the action comes after Paytm Payments Bank’s “persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, the central bank slapped the listed fintech giant’s subsidiary with </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-slaps-inr-5-39-cr-penalty-on-paytm-payments-bank-for-violating-kyc-norms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an INR 5.39 Cr penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for non-compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) norms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the RBI also flagged six major issues with the payments bank, including failure to identify beneficial owners in respect of onboarded entities for providing payout services, the failure to monitor payout transactions and carry out risk profiling of entities availing payout services, and failure to report cybersecurity incidents without delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2022, the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to stop onboarding new customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a restriction which is still ongoing. While the payments bank expressed hope in September 2023 that the restrictions </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be lifted in March 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the latest RBI action might have thrown a spanner in the works on that front.</span></p>

<p>While stating that there would be no changes related to taxation and proposing to retain the same tax rates for direct and indirect taxes, including import duties, she spoke about the provision of tax benefits for startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;certain tax benefits to startups and investments made by sovereign wealth or pension funds as also tax exemption on certain income of some IFSC units are expiring on 31.03.2024. To provide continuity in taxation, I propose to extend the date to 31.03.2025,&#8221; the finance minister said.</p>
<p>“As for tax proposals, in keeping with the convention, I do not propose to make any changes relating to taxation and propose to retain the same tax rates for direct taxes and indirect taxes including import duties,” she added.</p>
<p>The Government of India established the Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) in 2020 under the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019.</p>
<p>This authority oversees the development and regulation of financial products, services, and institutions within the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT city.</p>
<p>Certain tax concessions related to IFSC are tied to the condition of starting of IFSC operations on or before March 31, 2024. For instance, these concessions apply to the investment division of an offshore banking unit and cover aspects such as tax relief for royalty/interest income from aircraft/ship leasing.</p>
<p>As the deadline neared, the startup community was keeping an eye on a potential announcement for extension of the exemption to promote sustained financial growth in IFSC.</p>
<p>The government has announced several tax benefits for startups over the last few years to boost the startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Last week, the Centre also notified the rules for direct listing of Indian companies on the exchanges of the GIFT City.</p>
<p>Since the 2019 notice announcing angel tax exemption for startups, 8,066 DPIIT-recognised startups have been granted exemption from angel tax, Inc42 reported earlier.</p>
<p>To qualify for the angel tax exemption, startups are required to submit Form 2 for Section 56(2)(viib) affirming they aren&#8217;t investing in assets like land, buildings, vehicles costing more than INR 10 lakh, or other specific assets, unless utilised for specific business-related activities.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing funding winter, India maintained its position as the third-largest global tech startup ecosystem, boasting over 68K+ tech startups and a robust network of 9.7K+ investors.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal first reported the development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal between Viacom18 and Disney comes after Reliance and Walt Disney signed a </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/reliance-signs-non-binding-term-sheet-with-disney-for-merger-of-india-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-binding term sheet </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to merge their Indian media operations in December last year. The deal saw Reliance agreeing to buy Walt Disney Co.’s India operations in a cash and stock deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Reliance-Disney deal materialises, it would create a media giant with approximately INR 25,000 Cr in combined revenues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, earlier last month, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries and New York Stock Exchange-listed company Walt Disney have reportedly a</span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/reliance-disney-initiate-antitrust-examination-for-india-media-merger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ppointed law firms and initiated antitrust due diligence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their proposed merger in the Indian media and entertainment sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliance roped in Indian law firms Khaitan &amp; Co and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, while Disney engaged AZB &amp; Partners, Reuters reported, citing sources close to the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, reports first surfaced that </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/reliance-to-acquire-walt-disney-indias-business-in-a-cash-stock-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliance was evaluating Disney&#8217;s India assets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, encompassing the Disney+ Hotstar streaming service and Star India, at a valuation ranging from $7 billion to $8 billion. During the same period, Disney valued these operations at $10 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, post the dissolution of the Sony-Zee merger, Disney Star’s valuation reportedly took a significant hit, </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/disney-star-faces-potential-2-bn-downgrade-by-reliance-amid-zee-sony-fallout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially amounting to $2 Bn. </span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitharaman said that the new scheme would expedite the Modi government’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ vision, emphasising that the country needs programmes that combine the powers of youth and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development comes at a time when the Centre is focusing on developing segments such as artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor manufacturing, spacetech, and other allied sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her speech, the FM also announced a corpus of INR 1 Lakh Cr to provide 50-year interest-free loans for research and development in the sunrise sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The corpus will provide long-term financing or refinancing with long tenors, and low or nil interest rates. This will encourage the private sector to scale up research and innovation significantly in sunrise domains,” the minister said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In last year’s Union Budget, Sitharaman had announced setting up three Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for AI in top educational institutions. The Centre then also proposed a National Data Governance Policy to enable widespread access to anonymised datasets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the Indian government&#8217;s announcements during the interim Budget 2024 to further boost deeptech, Ankur Bansal, cofounder and director of BlackSoil, said, “The FM&#8217;s interim budget announcement on deeptech aligns with our expectations… The proposed scheme focused on deeptech defence technologies will not only ignite innovation and bolster national security but also provide a fertile ground for startups to thrive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, this will encourage entrepreneurship, helped by the announcement of establishing the INR 1 Lakh Cr corpus for research and innovation in sunrise areas, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting a similar sentiment, Sukhmani Bedi, partner at Orios VP, said that the “massive” INR 1 Lakh Cr corpus with long-tenor, low-cost capital not only provides a runway for research advancements but also incentivises the private sector to boost innovation capacities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Combined with the new scheme to expedite defence-focussed deeptech and sops for startups to encourage IP generation, this landscape oils India’s rise as a scientific powerhouse. For venture capital funds like Orios VP, these directives stimulate a thriving ecosystem for audacious science entrepreneurs to build game-changing products,” said Bedi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has raised a total funding of $177 Mn till date from investors such as Qualcomm Ventures, Warburg Pincus, InnoVen Capital, Navi Technologies, and Fireside Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It competes against startups like Noise, and Mivi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the back of the fresh infusion, boAt has also announced a strategic partnership with Singh, it said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This alliance also unveils Ranveer Singh&#8217;s pivotal role in boAt&#8217;s upcoming campaign for the &#8216;Nirvana series,&#8217; a sub-brand offering premium audio products, including TWS and headphones designed for an unparalleled listening experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Aman Gupta and Sameer Mehta in 2015, boAt operates in the larger audio and wearables markets and sells products such as headphones, smart watches and speakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Delhi NCR-based startup’s operating revenue rose 18% to INR 3,376.7 Cr in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23) from INR 2,873 Cr in the previous fiscal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">boAt earned INR 2,350.8 Cr in FY23 from the audio segment, which accounted for 70% of its operating revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ranveer&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment and strategic involvement validate our mission to revolutionise the audio experience in India. Together, we&#8217;ll push boundaries, redefine sound, and create a community that thrives on passion and innovation,” said Gupta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“boAt&#8217;s commitment to top-tier sound quality and its connection with the youth resonates deeply with me. Investing in their journey goes beyond a financial decision; it&#8217;s about co-creating a revolution,” Singh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this development, Singh joined a group of brand ambassadors for boAt like Jemimah Rodrigues, Kiara Advani, Rashmika Mandanna, Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/india-smart-wearable-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The India Smart Wearables market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to register a CAGR of 23.91% over the forecast period (2022 &#8211; 2027). </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/boat-leads-indias-wearables-market-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smartwatch was the fastest-growing category</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the wearables market. The segment crossed 12 Mn shipments in a single quarter, a growth of 3.8X compared to 4.3 Mn units shipped in Q3 2021. This spike was a result of a 30.3% decrease in the average selling price, going from $60 in Q3 2021 to $41.9 in Q3 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased consumer awareness of the need to adopt energy-efficient products, changing lifestyles, rising incomes, and improved living standards drive consumers to spend more on utilities, fostering market expansion. Furthermore, the market has chances for growth due to technical developments, increased availability of low-cost, high-quality products, and other factors.</span></p>

<p>The government will expand and strengthen the EV ecosystem by supporting manufacturing and setting up charging infrastructure in the country, the FM said.</p>
<p>Further, the government will promote adoption of electric buses for public transportation by introducing a payment security mechanism.</p>
<p>Earlier in August 2023, the Union Cabinet <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/centre-green-lights-inr-57k-cr-scheme-to-deploy-10k-electric-buses-shore-up-ev-infra/">approved a new scheme</a> under which 10,000 electric buses (ebuses) would be deployed in 169 cities on a public-private partnership (PPP) model.</p>
<p>Also, in December 2023, <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/india-partners-us-to-launch-390-mn-financing-mechanism-to-deploy-50k-ebuses-by-2027/">India partnered the US government </a>and American philanthropic groups, as part of a $390 Mn joint financing mechanism, to deploy more than 50,000 electric buses on the country’s roads by 2027.</p>
<p>The initiative will cover cities with a population of more than 3 Lakh people, encompassing all capital cities, the North-Eastern region and hill states. The scheme will prioritise cities with no organised bus service.</p>
<p>The government is also looking to build 6,000 KM of electric vehicle-ready highways on the Golden Quadrilateral in a bid to reduce fuel consumption and vehicular emissions via electrification of intercity public transport. This is planned over the next seven years to boost the adoption of e-mobility and deployment of e-buses,</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corpus will provide long-term financing with ‘low or nil’ interest rates to fuel private sector research and development (R&amp;D) in the sunrise sectors, the FM said in her interim Budget speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For our tech-savvy youth, this will be a golden era. A corpus of INR 1 Lakh Cr will be established with a 50-year interest-free loan. The corpus will provide long-term financing or refinancing with long tenures at low or nil interest rates. This will help the private sector to scale up research in sunrise domains,” Sitharaman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that there was a need for building programmes that combine the powers of Indian youth and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is pertinent to note that <a href="https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">this was the interim Budget</a> and a full budget will be presented post general elections slated later this year.</span></p>
<h2><b>What’s In Store?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is no clarity yet on the contours of this new corpus, the funds will go directly towards strengthening the research ecosystem in the country. The move will likely benefit startups, especially in areas such as spacetech, artificial intelligence, deeptech, and semiconductors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also address the demands of the ecosystem for long-tenure loans as research is a time-intensive process and the journey from an initial prototype to the final product takes years. The credit rollout will enable homegrown players to focus on building indigenous technologies with global applications and give a much-needed push to the homegrown startup ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new corpus will also fuel R&amp;D in capital-intensive and research-centric fields such as deeptech, which have seen a resurgence in the recent past. The move is also in line with the Centre’s plans to turn India into a research hub, which is expected to directly help budding startups in these emerging domains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interim Budget, the FM also unveiled a new scheme to <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/interim-budget-2024-fm-announces-a-new-scheme-to-strengthen-deeptech-for-defence-purposes/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">strengthen the deployment of deeptech technologies for defence purposes</a> and accelerating self-reliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, various arms of the government have announced a slew of incentives and initiatives for startups in the recent past to remote R&amp;D in their respective sectors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last month, the Union government sought proposals from research organisations and other stakeholders to <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/govt-seeks-proposals-from-academic-research-hubs-to-develop-responsible-ai/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">build indigenously developed “tools and frameworks”</a> that advocate for fair and ethical advancement of AI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November last year, the <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/govt-invites-proposals-from-startups-msmes-to-promote-rd-in-mining/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">Ministry of Mines invited proposals from startups</a> for building prototypes in the mining, mineral processing, metallurgy, and recycling sectors. The initiative offered funding for projects up to two years in duration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to that, an expert panel also urged the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/meity-panel-recommends-setting-up-semiconductor-research-centre-at-a-cost-of-8-bn/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">establish a semiconductor research centre</a> at an initial outlay of $8 Bn over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While India&#8217;s R&amp;D expenditure is reportedly among the highest globally, the ecosystem continues to be plagued by issues such as a lack of talent, high-quality research, adequate infrastructure and red tape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the government aims to address these challenges by envisaging this mega INR 1 Lakh Cr fund, it remains to be seen how Indian startups leverage this opportunity and further fuel R&amp;D in the country. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes hours after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-bars-paytm-payments-bank-from-providing-upi-service-taking-deposits-in-customer-accounts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directed Paytm Payments Bank to cease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accepting new deposits in its accounts or wallets after February 29.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of this regulatory action, Paytm has been informed that it cannot undertake fresh deposits, support credit transactions, or provide fund transfers, including the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) facility, beyond the specified date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm Payments Bank, associated with One 97 Communications Limited (OCL), is taking immediate steps to comply with RBI&#8217;s directions. OCL, a payments company, works with various banks, not just Paytm Payments Bank, on various payment products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exchange filing on February 1, Paytm said that its wholly-owned banking subsidiary “is taking immediate steps to comply with RBI directions, including working with the regulator to address their concerns as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the directive to terminate the nodal account of OCL and Paytm Payments Services Limited (PPSL) by February 29, 2024, both entities will transition the nodal account to alternative banks within this timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OCL is actively seeking collaborations with various banks to diversify its payment product offerings for customers. Importantly, OCL&#8217;s additional financial services, encompassing loan distribution, insurance distribution, and equity broking, remain independent of Paytm Payments Bank Limited and are anticipated to remain unaffected by this regulatory direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the exchange filing made by Paytm, the latest RBI action will cost the listed fintech giant </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-action-on-paytm-payments-bank-to-impact-up-to-inr-500-cr-in-paytms-annual-ebitda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">INR 300-500 Cr in annual EBITDA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, brokerage firm Jefferies has downgraded the payment aggregator to &#8216;underperform&#8217; from a &#8216;buy&#8217; call and reduced the target price for the stock by more than half to INR 500 from INR 1,050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferies&#8217; new target price reflects a downside potential of over 34% for the Paytm stock.</span></p>
<h2><b>Paytm Payment Bank’s Frequent Run-Ins With The RBI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time Paytm Payments Bank has come into RBI’s crosshairs. According to the January 31 RBI press note, the action comes after Paytm Payments Bank’s “persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, the central bank slapped the listed fintech giant’s subsidiary with </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-slaps-inr-5-39-cr-penalty-on-paytm-payments-bank-for-violating-kyc-norms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an INR 5.39 Cr penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for non-compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) norms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the RBI also flagged six major issues with the payments bank, including failure to identify beneficial owners in respect of onboarded entities for providing payout services, the failure to monitor payout transactions and carry out risk profiling of entities availing payout services, and failure to report cybersecurity incidents without delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2022, the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to stop onboarding new customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a restriction which is still ongoing. While the payments bank expressed hope in September 2023 that the restrictions </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be lifted in March 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the latest RBI action might have thrown a spanner in the works on that front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferies&#8217; new target price reflects a downside potential of over 34% for the Paytm stock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cut EBITDA (ex-ESOP) by 46%/ 44% in FY25/26E led by a 7-10% cut to payments revenues and a 17-24% cut in lending revenues and compression in payments margins. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the impact of a 10% change in disbursements is low on revenues (2%), but high on EBITDA (15%). We adjust our DCF valuations to account for lower growth and margins. Our implied valuation multiple stands reduced by 30% to 15X FY26E EBITDA,” Jefferies said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RBI&#8217;s actions directly impact the wallet business and profitability of merchant payments business, which can impact EBITDA by 20-30%. We see the impact being much larger due to reputational concerns around the group. Lending business (~20% of revenues) can be significantly hit if lending partners cut back or limit their exposure. These drive us to cut FY25-26 EBITDA estimates by 45%, which will also delay profitability,” the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brokerage firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shares of Paytm on Thursday (February 1) nosedived 20% to hit the lower circuit at INR 608.8 on the BSE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brokerage firm Macquarie said the implications of the RBI ban are quite serious but maintained its &#8216;neutral&#8217; rating on the stock and a PT of INR 650.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the severe restrictions imposed on PBPL, we believe it significantly hampers Paytm&#8217;s ability to retain customers in its ecosystem, and accordingly restricts it from selling payment products and loan products. We think revenue and profitability implications in the medium to long term could be significant and remain a key item to monitor,” said Macquarie&#8217;s Suresh Ganapathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the banking arm of the listed fintech giant said it is working with the sector regulator to address concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exchange filing on February 1, Paytm said that its wholly-owned banking subsidiary “is taking immediate steps to comply with RBI directions, including working with the regulator to address their concerns as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the filing, the latest RBI action will </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-action-on-paytm-payments-bank-to-impact-up-to-inr-500-cr-in-paytms-annual-ebitda/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost it INR 300-500 Cr in annual EBITDA </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paytm also informed the exchanges that the RBI notification does not impact user deposits in their savings accounts, wallets, FASTags and NCMC (National Common Mobility Cards) accounts, where they can continue to use the existing balances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBI, in a press statement yesterday (January 31), said, “No further deposits or credit transactions or top ups shall be allowed in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, NCMC cards (National Common Mobility Cards), etc. after February 29, 2024, other than any interest, cashbacks, or refunds which may be credited anytime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI said that the Nodal Accounts of One97 Communications Ltd and Paytm Payments Services Ltd. are to be terminated at the earliest, in any case by February 29, 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulator has taken the step after Paytm Payments Bank’s “persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2022, the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank Ltd to stop onboarding new customers with immediate effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as per the central bank, the Comprehensive System Audit report and subsequent compliance validation report of the external auditors revealed non-compliance, warranting further supervisory action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RBI also said that withdrawal or utilisation of balances by Paytm Payments Bank’s customers from their accounts, including savings bank accounts, current accounts, prepaid instruments, FASTags, and NCMC, would be permitted till their available balance.</span></p>
<p>Motilal Oswal has also downgraded Paytm to a &#8216;neutral&#8217; rating and cut its PT on the stock to INR 575.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paytm has recently announced its plan to downsize its BNPL operations and was working to mitigate the impact by scaling up higher-ticket personal and merchant loans. Against this backdrop, the latest measures raise serious concerns over its business outlook and dent overall investor confidence,&#8221; the brokerage said.</p>
<h2><b>Paytm Payment Bank’s Frequent Run-Ins With The RBI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time Paytm Payments Bank has come into the RBI’s crosshairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, the central bank slapped the listed fintech giant’s subsidiary with </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-slaps-inr-5-39-cr-penalty-on-paytm-payments-bank-for-violating-kyc-norms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an INR 5.39 Cr penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for non-compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) norms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the RBI also flagged six major issues with the payments bank, including failure to identify beneficial owners in respect of onboarded entities for providing payout services, the failure to monitor payout transactions and carry out risk profiling of entities availing payout services, and failure to report cybersecurity incidents without delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March 2022, the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to stop onboarding new customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a restriction which is still ongoing. While the payments bank expressed hope in September 2023 that the restrictions </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-hopeful-about-rbi-lifting-customer-onboarding-restrictions-by-march-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be lifted in March 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the latest RBI action might have thrown a spanner in the works on that front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development comes hours after the </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/rbi-bars-paytm-payments-bank-from-providing-upi-service-taking-deposits-in-customer-accounts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RBI barred Paytm Payments Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from any deposits, credit transactions, or top-ups in any of its customer accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banking arm of the listed fintech giant has said it is working with the sector regulator to address concerns.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, the RBI said that the Nodal Accounts of One97 Communications Ltd and Paytm Payments Services Ltd are to be terminated at the earliest, in any case by February 29, which gives the listed giant around four weeks to address the situation. In response to that, Paytm notified that both companies will move the nodal to other banks during this period. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OCL will pursue partnerships with various other banks to offer various payment products to its customers,” said Paytm.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this move, Gokhale aims to build a platform that provides farm solutions to mid-sized Indian farmers holding 2 to 10 hectares of farmland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Swiggy executive has joined forces with Aishwarya Ramakrishnan, Krish-e&#8217;s former head of strategy, growth and operations, to launch the initiative. Launched in 2020, Krish-e is an omnichannel marketplace for all agricultural needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking to LinkedIn, the erstwhile Swiggy executive announced, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;After an enriching 6 year journey at Swiggy, I am starting up again in a sector that has always fascinated me -&gt; agriculture! Happy to partner with Aishwarya Ramakrishnan in this journey as we zero in on an idea and launch Orbit Farming.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new venture, the duo aims to help mid-sized farmers increase their farm income. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are building India’s largest farming mechanisation solutions platform enabling mid-sized farms to achieve higher profitability,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gokhale added in his post.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, according to Orbit Farming’s LinkedIn page, the startup aims to bridge the gap between traditional farming practices and modern, technology-driven solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, both Gokhale and Ramakrishnan </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are actively hiring to build a founding team that could relate to their mission of empowering mid-sized farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Swiggy, Gokhale led hiring, retention, engagement and fleet (delivery partners) sufficiency at the hyperlocal level for Swiggy food and Instamart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before joining Swiggy in 2017, the IIT Bombay alumnus had founded Truce-True Price, an agritech startup, in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramakrishnan, on the other hand, was engaged with Mahindra&#8217;s agritech business, Krish-e, for three and a half years before finally calling it quits in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this, the cofounders have joined a growing number of Indian executives leaving their existing company roles </span><a href="https://inc42.com/features/spring-time-for-second-time-founders-india-startups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to float new ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, former chief executive of Times Internet </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/times-internet-veteran-gautam-sinha-floats-new-ai-startup-to-simplify-contract-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gautam Sinha launched a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SimpleO.ai. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More lately, </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/swiggy-instamart-architect-karthik-gurumurthys-venture-nets-3-mn-led-by-matrix-partners-india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karthik Gurumurthy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the architect behind Swiggy Instamart, secured $3 Mn (around INR 25 Cr) for his new offline retail venture, Convenio. His new platform will operate in the offline space and will mirror Swiggy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yadav has over 36 years of experience in the banking sector, including 29 years at the RBI. He has worked in diverse areas including supervision, regulation, rural development, financial inclusion, human resources management, NEFSB said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes a month after the bank </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/veteran-banker-satish-kalra-named-north-east-sfbs-md-to-spearhead-slice-merger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointed former Andhra Bank executive Satish Kumar Kalra </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as its interim managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO). Kalra’s key responsibility includes leading the merger process between Slice and NESFB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, fintech unicorn </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/fintech-unicorn-slice-merges-with-north-east-small-finance-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slice announced its plans to merge with NESFB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and said it had received the central bank’s approval for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commenting on his appointment, Yadav said, “With its upcoming merger with slice, NESFB is set to establish a distinctly inclusive and innovative digital presence. I am honoured to contribute to this endeavour and be part of NESFB’s journey to forge a path of innovation and excellence in the banking sector.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiming in, Kalra said, “Our continuous endeavour is to fortify the bank&#8217;s leadership with an emphasis on exceptional governance and diligent oversight. The addition of Yadav as an independent director to the NESFB board is a strategic move in this direction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The merger with NESFB will allow slice to acquire an SFB licence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and weather the regulatory uncertainty that plagues the larger fintech sector. In addition, the move will pave the way for slice to bolster its credit and banking ambitions as regulated entities have access to funds (via customer deposits) for credit at a better rate than most fintechs and NBFCs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed merger will also help slice to largely subvert regulatory troubles like it faced in the previous year due to </span><a href="https://inc42.com/features/slices-existential-threat-can-fintech-unicorns-shaky-business-model-survive-rbis-ppi-notification/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the RBI’s diktat on prepaid payment instruments </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(PPIs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">slice’s parent Garagepreneurs Internet Private Limited saw its </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/fintech-unicorn-slice-spent-inr-1-5-to-earn-every-rupee-in-fy23/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">net loss rise 60% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 405.8 Cr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in FY23, while its operating revenue surged 199% YoY to INR 846.7 Cr. </span></p>

<p>Wiz Freight has officially announced raising INR 125 Cr ($15 Mn) in a Series B funding round. The round saw participation from Tiger Global Management, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nippon Express Fund, Axilor Technologies Fund, and Arali Investments. </span></p>
<hr />
<p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Original Story| January 4, 22:48 PM</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chennai-based supply chain startup Wiz Freight has raised INR 93.3 Cr (around $11.2 Mn) as part of its Series B funding round. Led by Japan-based SBI Investments, the round also saw participation from Tiger Global, Nippon Express Fund, Axilor Technologies Fund, Arali Investments and Unikon Shipping Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an Entrackr report, the startup plans to raise $30 Mn in the Series B round in two tranches of $15 Mn each, at a valuation of $175 Mn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the filings, the Wiz Freight board has passed a special resolution to issue 1,790 Series B compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) at an issue price of around INR 5.21 Lakh each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SBI Investments led the round with INR 33.3 Cr while Tiger Global, Nippon Express Fund, and Axilor Technologies Fund pumped in INR 18.71 Cr, INR 16.62 Cr, and INR 10.42 Cr, respectively. Arali and Unikon also participated with INR 14.32 Cr cumulatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use these proceeds for growth, expansion, and general corporate activities, as per filings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in August 2020 by Ramkumar Govindarajan and Ramkumar Ramachandran, Wiz Freight helps exporters and importers book, as well as manage, cross-border shipments through its platform. Its offerings include cargo insurance, air freight, customs clearance, FCL and LCL shipping, trade advisory and land transport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup claims to have 50 offices across the world, shipping 45,744 twenty-feet equivalent units (TEUs) and 2,882 air tonnage as of 2023. The startup claims to have offices in India, the US, UAE, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding round comes nearly two years after the startup <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/tiger-global-leads-36-3-mn-series-a-funding-in-supplytech-startup-wiz-freight/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">raised INR 275 Cr (around $36.3 Mn) in its Series A funding round led by Tiger Global</a>. In January 2022, Wiz Freight <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/full-stack-freight-management-startup-wiz-freight-secures-inr-20-cr-in-debt-funding/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">raised INR 20 Cr in debt funding</a> from Stride Ventures. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiz Freight has raised over $50 Mn to date.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7158446846246301698/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener">post</a> on LinkedIn, Kaushik said it was time for new beginnings. “After an enriching time at Aavishkaar Capital, it&#8217;s time for new beginnings… As I move forward, I am excited to take on new challenges and continue building businesses and investing in the future,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Inc42&#8217;s query on the matter, Vineet Rai, founder of the Aavishkaar Group, said, &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sushma spent 13 years with Aavishkaar and wanted to explore a world beyond it after pretty much spending most of her early life with us&#8230; she remains deeply committed to Aavishkaar despite this transition. Aavishkaar has a long tradition of offering women leadership to private equity space and we see our alum as our ambassador to the world of private equity.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2001 by Rai, Aavishkaar Capital invests in early-stage startups in India. AgroStar, Newtrace, Mooofarm, and Chqbook are among the startups in its portfolio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaushik joined the VC firm in 2011 as a senior investment manager. She became a partner at the firm in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is pertinent to note that the VC ecosystem saw several partner-level departures in 2023, including those at Orios Venture Partners, Lightbox, Rebright, Venture Highway, Lightrock India, and Together Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Avinash Raghava, partner at Together Fund, stepped down in March, three partners at Lightbox — Siddharth Talwar, Prashant Mehta, and Jeremy Wenokur – exited in August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, Orios Venture Partners also saw the exits of managing partners Anup Jain and Rajeev Suri in September last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://inc42.com/features/indian-vcs-see-headwinds-in-2023-partner-exits-fund-splits-hurt-investors/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exits in VC firms took place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amid a slowdown in investments and increasing troubles in various portfolio companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Lightbox is dealing with the problems in beleaguered quick commerce startup Dunzo, Orios had to write off its investment in GoMechanic following the company’s corporate governance trouble. Another Orios portfolio startup Pharmeasy has also seen a major devaluation in the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid all these, Omidyar Network last week said it would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">completely transition out of the India market by the end of 2024.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 70% of the funding will be raised from existing investors, including Celesta Capital, Omnivore, Gates Foundation, IDH Farmfit Fund, Blume Ventures, and Qualcomm Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confirming the development, Stellapps cofounder and CEO Ranjith Mukundan told Inc42 that a couple of new investors are also likely to participate in the funding round. However, he didn’t disclose the name of the new investors and the valuation at which the startup is looking to raise the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup intends to utilise the fresh capital for further expansion, with a special focus on value-added dairy products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by IIT alumni and ex-Wipro employees Mukundan, Ravi Shiroor, Ramakrishna Adukuri, Praveen Nale and Venkatesh Seshasayee in 2011, Stellapps provides a full-stack Internet of Things (IoT) platform to digitise and optimise the entire milk supply chain, right from production to procurement and storage. The platform also connects farmers with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial &amp; insurance institutions, cattle nutrition providers, agro-input providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around July last year, the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">also began processing milk to supply value-added dairy products to B2B companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup currently provides curd, ghee, paneer, buttermilk, double-toned milk, among others, to FMCG brands. It has two processing plants, one in Uttar Pradesh and another in Bengaluru, and is looking to add two more plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also considering making ice-cream and selling it under a private label to other businesses,” Mukundan added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to a question about choosing the B2B route for its dairy products, Mukundan said that B2C businesses require a lot of capital to create a brand and to acquire customers. </span></p>
<h2><b>Stellapps’ IPO Dreams</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dairy tech startup is eyeing an initial public offering in the next 36-48 months, as per the CEO.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;we’re building our brand towards IPO and (want to) provide our investors a 5X return. We are working towards listing our company at around $450 Mn-$500 Mn valuation during the IPO,” Mukundan added.  </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is on track to close the ongoing financial year with revenue of INR 400 Cr and is eyeing a revenue of INR 2,000 Cr in the next three to four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stellapps last raised an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">undisclosed amount of funding from <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/dairytech-startup-stellapps-secures-funding-from-idh-farmfit-to-boost-farmer-net-income/">IDH FarmFit in 2022</a>, a few months after <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/dairytech-startup-stellapps-raises-18-mn-series-c-funding/">it raised </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$18 Mn in its Pre-Series C funding round from global animal nutrition and aquaculture company Nutreco. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipkart has rolled out the same-day delivery services for multiple products, including, mobiles, fashion, beauty products, lifestyle, books, home appliances and electronics, among others, across 20 cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cities include Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Coimbatore, Chennai, Delhi, Guwahati, Hyderabad and Indore, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is pertinent to mention here that the Walmart-backed company started its same-day delivery across 10 cities in 2014 but later brought down the curtain on its services. Back then, it was charging users a shipping fee of INR 200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new service, customers can get their orders delivered before midnight if they place the order by 1 PM, the firm said in a statement, adding that the feature will be scaled to other cities over the next few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipkart claims to have invested in multiple fulfilment centres, along with tech capabilities for better sorting of products, last year to enable same-day delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took months of planning to ensure that orders would be fulfilled from the nearest fulfilment centre, minimising transit times and enhancing the overall efficiency of the delivery process, the statement added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering that customers not just from metro cities but non-metros cities love to shop on Flipkart, we are working to provide same-day delivery to 20 cities, reinforcing our commitment to staying at the forefront of customer satisfaction. We will further scale it in the months to come, to include more cities and more categories including large appliances, to delight the customers,” said Hemant Badri, SVP, group head of supply chain, customer experience and recommerce business at Flipkart Group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes days after </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkarts-fintech-dreams-rolls-out-upi-offering-for-select-users/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipkart rolled out its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) offering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the first batch of users as another step towards strengthening its presence in the fintech sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the business expansion, the company is also expected to lay off a few employees over the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per a Moneycontrol report, the company is slashing around 1,000 jobs as part of its annual performance review process. Accordingly, the team size is expected to be cut by 5%. Earlier, another report said that the layoff would impact around 5-7% of the total workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has around 22,000 employees on its payroll currently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a source aware of the development told Inc42 that the layoff numbers are speculative. The company routinely conducts performance reviews and its result would only be known by the end of March-April, the source added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October last year, </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkart-sets-sights-on-loyal-shoppers-with-vip-membership-rollout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flipkart unveiled “Flipkart VIP”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at a price point of INR 499 per annum, INR 500 less than Amazon Prime membership. Under the membership, the company provides free same-day/next-day deliveries for VIP members in selected areas. The company didn&#8217;t specify if one day delivery is exclusive only to VIP members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is pertinent to note with the increase in access to smartphones, UPI and the overall digital payments infrastructure have boomed in the country. Most recently, foodtech major Zomato and global digital payments startup Stripe’s Indian arm have also received the RBI’s nod to function as an online payment aggregator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s B2C arm, Flipkart Internet Private Limited spent INR 6,571.2 Cr on </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkarts-b2c-arms-sales-near-inr-15000-cr-mark-fy23-loss-dips-to-inr-4026-cr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transportation expenses in FY23</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an increase of 30% from INR 5,045.6 Cr in the previous fiscal year. Its operating revenue in the year stood at INR 14,845.8 Cr, up 42% from INR 10,477.4 Cr it raked in in FY22. The group&#8217;s chief executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy said the company </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkart-nearing-profitability-helped-by-reduction-in-monthly-cash-burn-krishnamurthy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearing profitability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the back of a significant reduction in monthly cash burn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is pertinent to note that the recovery of IPO expenses worth INR 4.77 Cr from stakeholders had </span><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/tracxn-q3-fy23-pat-grows-nearly-500to-inr-6-21-cr-on-recovery-of-ipo-expenses/" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosted the startup’s profit in Q3 FY23</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Excluding the exceptional gain in the year-ago quarter, Tracxn’s PAT increased almost 55% YoY from INR 1.4 Cr in Q3 FY23.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, its PAT saw a 2.4% increase from INR 2.17 Cr posted in Q2 FY24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the company continues to witness muted growth. Tracxn reported INR 21.1 Cr in operating revenue in the reported quarter, which was a 4.4% rise YoY from INR 20.2 Cr posted in Q3 FY23. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was also a 1.6% decline quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) from INR 21.5 Cr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup said that its Q3 FY24 PAT margin of 10.5% was the highest quarterly PAT margin reported till date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a market intelligence platform, which tracks company financials and captables of entities across the globe, Tracxn has a wide range of customer base including private market investors such as venture capital and private equity firms and investment banks as well as corporates, government agencies, government banks, academic institutions, and startup accelerators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It currently covers private company financials across over 20 countries and cap tables across over 15 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracxn said in its Q3 FY24 earnings statement that as the market opens up further from here on, the startup would improve its new customer acquisition as well as customer expansion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has also undertaken various initiatives for improving paid customer engagement as well as account expansion to enhance growth from its existing customers, it said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, its total expenses declined marginally both QoQ and YoY to INR 19.32 Cr in Q3 FY24, with employee benefit expenses witnessing a marginal rise YoY.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracxn spent INR 17 Cr towards employee benefit expenses during the reported quarter, which increased from INR 16.98 Cr in Q3 FY23.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup said that its expense growth rate had increased from 7% in FY22 to 16% in FY23, primarily due to increase in headcount. However, this has now eased back to 5% in the nine months in FY24.</span></p>
